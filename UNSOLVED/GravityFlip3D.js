/**
 * This kata is a slightly harder version of Gravity Flip.
 *  It is recommended to do that first.

Bob is bored in his physics lessons yet again, and this time,
 he's brought a more complex gravity-changing box with him. It's 3D, with small cubes arranged in a matrix of n√óm columns. It can change gravity to go in a certain direction, which can be 'L', 'R', 'D', and 'U' (left, right, down, and up).

Given the initial configuration of the cubes inside of the box as a 2D array,
 determine how the cubes are arranged after Bob switches the gravity.

See the sample tests for examples.

function flip(d, a) {
    if (d === 'U') {
    }
