Battleship (also Battleships or Sea Battle) is a guessing game for two players.
 Each player has a 10x10 grid containing several "ships" and objective is to destroy
  enemy's forces by targetting individual cells on his field. The ship occupies one
   or more cells in the grid. Size and number of ships may differ from version to version.
    In this kata we will use Soviet/Russian version of the game.
